# university-and-school-projects
This is a collection of projects and reports that I am proud of, from university and before.

Please note I have only included reports that I don't believe will compromise assignments for future students. Please get in contact if you think one or more should be taken down.

In rough order of how proud I am of the finished product, the documents are as follows:

## Biofilm Final Report

My Engineering Masters year project final report. The project was about exploring a novel imaging method for visualising the development of biofilms.

I may add the important parts of the code used to this repository at some point, if I get around to cleaning it up. If anyone reading this would find it useful, please get in touch, and I can accelerate that schedule.

## Muon HAB Project Writeup

For my last two years of school, up until the start of university, I worked on creating a homemade muon detector and long-distance radio and sending them up into the atmosphere on a high-altitude balloon in order to take measurements of the [RP curve](https://spaceweatherarchive.com/2018/06/07/what-is-the-regener-pfotzer-maximum/ "What is the RP curve?"). Amazingly enough, it actually worked, and the car trip in which I tracked the ascent and fall of the payload with my grandma (fingers crossed that it would actually keep transmitting, so we could recover it) was fantastically fun.

## Biomed Final Coursework

In this final year module, we had to pick a biomedical technology from four options, find an industrial application for it, and write up a proposal for bringing it to market. I picked Near Infra-Red Spectroscopy, for sleep monitoring in the ICU. Props to this coursework for teaching me just how many words I can write in 2.5 days while in a caffeine hole.

## Interport 20 Final A2A Solution

This was the result of a competition I took part in at school. I co-led a 7-person team to produce a proposal of a transport system to link the 5 major London airports, and put together the final report. This one was a blast, and we ended up joint-winning the competition with a maglev network.
