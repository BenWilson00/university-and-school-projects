# university-and-school-projects
This is a collection of projects and reports that I am proud of, from university and before.

Please note I have only included reports that I don't believe will compromise assignments for future students. Please get in contact if you think one or more should be taken down.

## Biofilm_final_report.pdf

My Engineering Masters year project final report. The project was about exploring a novel imaging method for visualising the development of biofilms.

I may add the important parts of the code used to this repository at some point, if I get around to cleaning it up. If anyone reading this would find it useful, please get in touch, and I can accelerate that schedule.
